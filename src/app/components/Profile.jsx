              <h1>HAYATO OMAE</h1>
              <p>Happy Birthday to you, Omae-chan!
I’ve always thought you were the most foolish and ridiculous guy in the world—someone who could probably crack a walnut with his butt as easily as breathing. Anyway, this is actually big news for me because, back when we were kids, you were just an average, unremarkable kid—like butt hair. And now, I’m completely shocked to see you’ve grown into the biggest butt hair of all.
Have a great life with your family, friends and partner!</p>
